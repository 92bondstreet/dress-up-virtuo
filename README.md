## 🐣 Introduction

Once steps done from [virtuo](https://github.com/92bondstreet/virtuo) repository, you are able to pay each actors according

* Rental properties (booked days, distance, deductible option...)

## 🎯 Objectives

**The workshop goal is to build a clean page that computes the debit and credit price of each rental actors.**

### 🏃‍♀️ Steps to do

* Help users to understand your page event they don’t know anything about your site
* Help users to compute the invoices in a clear and efficient manner.
* Help users to be clear about which action to take in a easy manner.

## 👩‍💻 Just tell me what to do

1. Fork the project via `github`

1. Clone your forked repository project `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dress-up-virtuo`

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace
❯ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/dress-up-virtuo.git
```

1. Open the entry point [/public/index.html](./public/index.html) in your browser

```sh
# macos cli
❯ open public/index.html
# linux cli
❯ xdg-open public/index.html
# or by double-clicking in your browser files
```

1. **Update the [public/index.html](./public/index.html) by adding html and css styles**

1. commit your different modifications:

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace/dress-up-virtuo
❯ git add -A && git commit -m "feat(compute): display the call to action button"
```

([why following a commit message convention?](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)

1. Don't forget to push before the end of the workshop

```sh
❯ git push origin master
```

**Note**: if you catch an error about authentication, [add your ssh to your github profile](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/).

1. If you need some helps on git commands, read [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

### Don't forget

1. **Focus only on web design, you don't need to modify the codebase**
2. **You don't need to update the [public/virtuo.js](./public/virtuo.js) file**
3. **If you change the [public/index.html](./public/index.html) selectors, you should probably update [public/virtuo.js](./public/virtuo.js) and [public/index.js](./public/index.js) files**
